	title = {The {China} {Lab} {Guide} to {Megablock} {Urbanisms}},
	abstract = {A wider conversation on the policies and collective experiences of large-scale development that are shaping China’s urban future.  Superblocks are the basic unit of China’s urban development, but they are also spatial instruments with social, cultural, environmental, and economic implications, operating between the scales of architecture and the city. These redefined ‘Megablocks’ then become laboratories for the consequences, opportunities, and potential global proliferation of Chinese urban models, reconsidered through the filters of ecology, economics, and ethics. In this bilingual Guide to Megablock Urbanisms, China Lab aims to document and advance China’s urban future.
